# ML Sentiment Analysis and Energy Prediction

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate the implementation of machine learning models for sentiment analysis and energy consumption prediction.

## Sentiment Analysis using SVM
In this notebook (Notebook 1), we apply the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to analyze the sentiment of sentences sourced from a dataset of labeled Arabic tweets. The dataset can be found at Twitter Data set for Arabic Sentiment Analysis. We preprocess the data and then train the SVM model to classify the tweets as having a positive or negative sentiment. Additionally, we compare our results with the implementations provided by popular Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Keras, and pyTorch.

## Energy Consumption Prediction using CART
The second notebook (Notebook 2) focuses on predicting the energy consumption of a house. We use the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) model on a dataset of energy forecasts for household appliances. The dataset can be found at Appliances energy prediction. We preprocess the data and train the CART model to approximate the energy usage. As with the previous notebook, we compare our results with implementations from Scikit-learn, Keras, pyTorch, and other relevant Python libraries.

## Report
The repository also contains a comprehensive report discussing the data description, preprocessing steps, application of machine learning techniques, presentation of results, comparisons with existing implementations, conclusions, and bibliography.

Please feel free to explore the notebooks and the report, and don't hesitate to provide feedback or suggestions.
